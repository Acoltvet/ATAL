Notes:
When cosmic rays (high-energy particles from space) hit the Earth’s atmosphere, they create secondary particles:
Muons (what the muon detector will measure)
Alpha particles, beta particles, and other charged radiation (what the cloud chamber will visualize)
Muon Detector gives you precise data on muons per second at different altitudes.
Cloud Chamber gives you visual confirmation of different types of radiation present.
Step 1: Build and Test the Muon Detector
Uses plastic scintillator and photomultiplier tubes (PMTs).
When a muon passes through, the scintillator lights up so the PMT detects the light and the microcontroller records it.
Stack two or more layers so that only real muons get detected.
Step 2: Build and Test the Cloud Chamber
Uses dry ice + alcohol vapor.
When radiation passes through, it ionizes the vapor, forming visible tracks.
You’ll see thick, short tracks for alpha particles, thin long tracks for beta particles, and straight tracks for muons.
Step 3: Launch the Muon Detector on a Balloon (100,000 ft)
The muon detector will record the number of muons at different altitudes.
Expect more muons at high altitude, then fewer as you go higher
Step 4: Compare Data
Compare muon counts at different altitudes to confirm how cosmic ray interactions change.
Use the cloud chamber at ground level to identify different types of radiation and confirm that muons exist in the mix.
