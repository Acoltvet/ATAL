# ATAL-

Notes:
When cosmic rays (high-energy particles from space) hit the Earthâ€™s atmosphere, they create secondary particles:
Muons (what the muon detector will measure)
Alpha particles, beta particles, and other charged radiation (what the camera will visualize)
Muon Detector gives you precise data on muons per second at different altitudes.
Camera gives you visual confirmation of different types of radiation present.

Step 1: reasearch how to make comic watch / moun detectors, the rasberry pi, the camerea, the battery case, and a parts list and BOM for everything. 

Step 2: Build and Test the Muon Detector
Uses plastic scintillator and photomultiplier tubes (PMTs).
When a muon passes through, the scintillator lights up so the PMT detects the light and the microcontroller records it.
Stack two or more layers so that only real muons get detected. 

Step 3: Build and Test the Camera
Uses teh rasberry pi and the batteries
This will visualize the ultravoilet and radiation particles that the box will see in the atmopshere
we will analyze the data / the amount of flashes of light we will see at each corrosponding alltitudes when it touches back down on the ground.

Step 4: Launch the Muon Detector and Camera on a Balloon (100,000 ft)
The muon detector will record the number of muons at different altitudes.
Expect more muons at high altitude, then fewer as you go higher
The camerea will detect all of the other raadiation particles that the moun detector will miss/
We expect the same thing as the moun detector, but with the other particles, and we hypothissis that the light intensity will increase as we rise.

Step 5: Compare Data
Compare muon counts at different altitudes to confirm how cosmic ray interactions change.
Comapre diffrent light readings detected by the camera at diffrent alltituddces to confirm how the moun particles and other particles density change
